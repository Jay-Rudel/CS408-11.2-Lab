# CS408 - Lab11.2
    In this project we are working on connecting with an API and using a database
    to store and access data. 

## Getting Started
    To get started, clone this repository, and then you can learn 
    to view it in the "Viewing" section. Which is below.

## Viewing
    I highly recommend using VSCode Live Server extention to see the project. This allows you to
    see the page, and interact with the page without having to open it in a local file.

    The file that you will be looking at for this project in my github is called "index.html"

## Testing
    I did not add any tests for this particular project. However, I 
    did manually each of the functions. One by adding items and then also with deleting them.


## Sources and Credits

    I was unsure on how exactly to to connect to the database saw the fetch in the readings and then used that for this project.

    Fetch knowledge:
